convert all surveys to one type with a list of days of the week.  no more daily-weekly typing for surveys.

todo: method of determining what survey is currently being modified in order to check the admin's editing privileges
<string:file_id>'

check that app-side file handling to only upload retired files is activated for the voice recording

Data Stream Toggles, customizable from the admin panel at the time of study creation:
-Accelerometer
-GPS
-Phone calls
-SMS and MMS (both sent and received)
-WiFi
-Bluetooth
-PowerStateListener (Screen on/off, Power connected/disconnected, shutdown/restart/boot)- should the three of these be one toggle, or three separate toggles?  One toggle is easier, engineering-wise.

Customizable Times, customizable from the admin panel at the time of study creation:
all of the time constants at the top of Timer.java:
UPLOAD_DATA_FILES_PERIOD, CREATE_NEW_DATA_FILES_PERIOD, CHECK_FOR_NEW_SURVEYS_PERIOD, WIFI_LOG_PERIOD, BLUETOOTH_ON_DURATION, BLUETOOTH_PERIOD, BLUETOOTH_START_TIME_IN_PERIOD (this one isn't listed in the change order because it would be hard to explain, but it is one of the constants that should be adjustable), ACCELEROMETER_ON_DURATION, ACCELEROMETER_OFF_MINIMUM_DURATION, GPS_ON_DURATION, GPS_OFF_MINIMUM_DURATION, VOICE_RECORDING_HOUR_OF_DAY, VOICE_RECORDING_MAX_TIME_LENGTH, MILLISECONDS_BEFORE_AUTO_LOGOUT
-There should also be default values for these, so that the researcher doesn't have to set all new values from scratch at the start of the study.
-We might also want to include error-checking (this isn't mentioned in the change order) so that, for example, BLUETOOTH_ON_DURATION must be no longer than BLUETOOTH_PERIOD minus BLUETOOTH_START_TIME_IN_PERIOD.

Customizable wording, customizable from the admin panel at the time of study creation:
-Text on the "Call Clinician" buttons throughout the app
-Main body text on Voice Recording screen
-About page text
-Text in the Toast that pops up after a user submits a completed survey
-Text in the Toast that pops up after a user submits a completed voice recording
We should probably limit text inputs to ASCII-only, not Unicode characters. The survey editor interface currently (June 29, 2015) has a check for Unicode characters in survey_designer.py/update_survey().

######################### FRONT END ########################
############################################################

change days of week to checkboxes instead of dropdown.

change the front page from a view of all device-users to a view of device-users and the study they are enrolled in, and only visible to studies the admin has access rights to

we need to create the following pages for admins:
    change passwords
    elevate to sysadmin?
    create new admin
    add admin to study
    add survey to study
    error page for admin permission denied (put in decorator)
    create new study
		CHECK THE "PASSWORDS.PY.EXAMPLE", *NOT* GLOBAL_PASSWORDS, FILE FOR DETAILS ON REQUIREMENTS FOR THESE PASSWORDS.
    	page must include a paraphrase of "enter encryption key here for the study, all user data stored by server will include require this password, recommend you use a totally random source like random.org"

Graph stuff
	-Make it look pretty for all the different types of survey questions
	-Fix crappy width scaling in the app; don't hard-code it to 200px wide or whatever it is

remove old data from s3:
	It's safe to wipe anything prior to 5/1/15.   The data Matt is using is all more recent than that, collected later in May and June.
	If it's easier to go by participant ID's, do ____NOT_____ delete the participant ID's below (these are what Matt is using, all others can go):
		7rzzd3
		6sod84
		ahhv9h
		c7hze5

		qrsmla
		fwgs3q
		g7s4zv

implement mongobackups of the mongo db on the server

setup new server

SSL on the new server

########################## GENERAL TASKS ###########################

since studies will have arbitrary time triggers, frequency triggers, and no longer have distinct names (daily, weekly, voice), and will instead be identified by some form of unique id, make sure that the timer data is included in the csv for survey answers.

############################ KNOWN BUGS ############################
####################################################################

MMS logging:
	-When we receive MMS messages, we are not grabbing the message length or the "sent time" timestamp.
	-Triple Logging of at least MMS messages:
		Eli tried tracking this behavior down, I'm not positive about it but the best data and answer I have is this:
			Messages live in different "boxes" (inbox, outbox, sent-box, draft-box) and the ContentObserver triggers on various types of updates related to these boxes. We filter out messages that are not in sent-box, this is the behavior I see:
				we get an update when a message moves from one box to another box, however, I swear that messages that are supposed to be in the draft-box frequently claim they are in the sent-box.  buh?  this must be false, I don't know how to filter the data to remove these false updates.
				MMS messages in the sent box get updated when they get read receipts...  the data for these read receipts is always there and is always null.
	-Josh tried tracking this down as well, there is a comment is smssentreceiver

if the background process is not running and a user presses a notification to take a survey, the app crashes.  This is probably due to the rendering of a dynamic page requiring access to the survey's json file, which it accesses through the file manager, which has not been instantiated.
	probably the best solution is to make the unencrypted files have their own reader?  that just creates more chances for conflicts....
	TODO: check order of instantiation of for the dynamically rendered pages. (uhg)

Look at the number input box in the survey, and see if changing android:inputType="number" to numberDecimal solves the problem of people putting more than one decimal point into the answer

######################## OPTIONAL THINGS ###########################
####################################################################

Admin Panel UI
	-Make user unable to hit "back" button after logout, and return to the admin panel http://stackoverflow.com/a/20652896/1789466
	-(Josh) Throw in an Admin Panel warning message (don't use IE < 8!)
	-Make the page reload after they create a new patient or remove a device


re-analyze whether the following is true:
	In RegistrationActivity: don't set username and password on the device UNTIL they've been validated by the server.  This would require substantial changes to PostRequest.java.  Leaving this as-is does not actually present any serious security flaws.

####################################################################
############################## FUTURE ##############################
####################################################################

App UI
	-define a style and prettify the UI
	-Get an app icon

add in more user device info, specifically I am thinking of android version, sdk version for debugging

Add crash logging:

	http://www.acra.ch/
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/601503/how-do-i-obtain-crash-data-from-my-android-application

Improve uploading: Build a listener for WiFi connected, then try to upload files and download surveys

Timers & data upload
	-Add an alert if the phone hasn't been able to upload in a long time?
	-Add a server-side alert if a patient hasn't uploaded data in a long time? - unlikely to be useful...

####################### ideas (these do not need to be acted on) #######################
########################################################################################

infrastructure to test if the app is working and reporting data, once it's been installed and registered?

implement a flask url function for a device's phone number changing. all it does is calls upload_device_ids(), add check to android... this means we have to store the phone number (or hash of) in order to check for changes.

Trying to log when the app was started: We can't determine whether the app was started on boot or started by the user opening it.  Maybe we should just give up on this.

if we restart the background service occasionally we can get around the user-disabled bluetooth "problem"

There is no way to inform the user that the encryption key is corrupted.

we may be able to reduce some HTTPS overhead using the following stackoverflow
