1. There is a bug on the survey editor page where sometimes after clicking save and deploy it does not save, just reloads the page.
    (Jeanette is working on replicating the issue, though it has also been noticed by other researchers)
    researcher says that they got the bug, and it saved schedule updates but not question updates... Jeanette says this is "bizarre" (not her experience)

2. list of additional customizable text strings and parameters:
    a. the message of a survey's notification
    b. text on the main screen of the beiwe app
    c. the duration of the toast message after completing a survey, or make it responsive to the length of the message.  include descriptive text about this on the ui


############################################################
################ ACTUALLY DO THESE THINGS ##################
############################################################

Eli:
1. investigate whether it is possible to provide the string for the two phone numbers _on the phone number entry page_ (should be, we are customizing the consent menu...)
2. change the "date" column in phone call logger to "timestamp"
3. architecture change - implement survey names in backend.
4. talk with zags about recommendations for database for beiwe, requires encryption and access control.
5. check behavior of the app generating unique device IDs and how that interacts with devices that are not phones.
6. remove old data from s3 (zagaran-beiwe bucket):
    a. It's safe to wipe anything prior to 5/1/15. The data Matt is using is all more recent than that, collected later in May and June.
    b. If it's easier to go by participant ID's, do ____NOT_____ delete the participant ID's below: 7rzzd3, 6sod84, ahhv9h, c7hze5, 66f1zz, qrsmla, fwgs3q, g7s4zv, yi279c, v26kw2
7. app debug - In RegistrationActivity, make sure we don't set username and password on the device UNTIL they've been validated by the server.
    a. if this would require substantial changes to PostRequest.java, don't implement change, move todo somewhere else.


Josh:
-Change the "password must be more than 6 characters" language to "password must be at least 6 characters"
-Probably don't enforce that the temporary registration password is 6+ characters long
-Figure out how to handle info text box questions in randomized surveys
0. check that the new key for app encryption does what we want it to do.
1. app - run your own tests on randomization, confirm whether it is working
2. website - Check why automatic logout keeps happening - it seems that the session expiration date does not get renewed on every pageload; only on login.
3. website - add a "confirm" field for the 32-character key that super-admins enter when they create a new study.
4. website/backend: See if we can use flask_login and standardized parameters so that not every page needs to pass in information about the logged in user
5. website - implement error checking for invalid or problematic values for timers on the study settings page
    a. maximum audio recording duration cannot be longer than the logout timer
    b. bluetooth global offset should not be longer than the other bluetooth timer values
6. website - error pages for admin permission denied, and survey not found (this redirect occurs in the survey/study access decorator, currently we just throw a 403 and 404, respectively)
7. website - I see 4 todos in base.html, footer.html, and view_study.html.  These are super low priority, but they don't show up in liclipse todo, so I'm sticking a reminder here.
8. Make a crude logo (just a capital letter "B" inside a square)


############################################################
########## Things to check in on in a few months ###########
############################################################

updates for data display in the app: it is really low priority.
feature proposal: add a third level of admins, study admiinistration
feature proposal: retire a study. (make a study appear as inactive or something)

####################################################################
######################## OPTIONAL THINGS ###########################
####################################################################

Admin Panel UI
    -Make user unable to hit "back" button after logout, and return to the admin panel http://stackoverflow.com/a/20652896/1789466
    -Make the page reload after they create a new patient or remove a device


########################################################################
######################### Future Improvements ##########################
########################################################################

add in more user device info, specifically I am thinking of android version, sdk version for debugging

Add crash logging:

    http://www.acra.ch/
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/601503/how-do-i-obtain-crash-data-from-my-android-application

Improve uploading: Build a _listener_ for WiFi connected, then try to upload files and download surveys

Timers & data upload
    -Add an alert if the phone hasn't been able to upload in a long time?
    -Add a server-side alert if a patient hasn't uploaded data in a long time? - unlikely to be useful...

Improve logging when the app was started
    -We can't determine whether the app was started on boot or started by the user opening it.

we may be able to reduce some HTTPS overhead using the following stackoverflow
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5643704/reusing-ssl-sessions-in-android-with-httpclient

Yet more work on bluetooth:
    ensure that phones running 5+ are broadcasting bluetooth beacons (does not work on 4.x)

merge mms and sms sent receivers if possible.

############################ KNOWN BUGS ############################
####################################################################

Known unknown bug: if the logout timer is less than the max voice recording time period... we have no idea what happens.
[this is Josh:] To answer the above, I'm pretty sure that nothing bad happens: the app automatically logs out, which triggers OnPause in the AudioRecordingActivity, which stops the recording and saves it.  It's bad UX, because the user might be logged out before they've finished the recording, but nothing should actually BREAK.

MMS logging:
    -When we receive MMS messages, we are not grabbing the message length or the "sent time" timestamp.
    -Triple Logging of at least MMS messages:
        Eli tried tracking this behavior down, I'm not positive about it but the best data and answer I have is this:
            Messages live in different "boxes" (inbox, outbox, sent-box, draft-box) and the ContentObserver triggers on various types of updates related to these boxes. We filter out messages that are not in sent-box, this is the behavior I see:
                we get an update when a message moves from one box to another box, however, I swear that messages that are supposed to be in the draft-box frequently claim they are in the sent-box.  buh?  this must be false, I don't know how to filter the data to remove these false updates.
                MMS messages in the sent box get updated when they get read receipts...  the data for these read receipts is always there and is always null.
    -Josh tried tracking this down as well, there is a comment is smssentreceiver

Look at the number input box in the survey, and see if changing android:inputType="number" to numberDecimal solves the problem of people putting more than one decimal point into the answer
