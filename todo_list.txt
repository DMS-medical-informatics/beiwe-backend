Write up security doc and take screenshots for IRB

App UI
-Finalize, style, and pretty-ify the UI
-Make keyboards appear (gain focus) automatically on the password, register, etc. screens, so that people don't have to tap the textfields as much
-Make RegisterActivity use a temporary password, and force you to immediately reset your password to something actually memorable
-Get an app icon

AudioRecorder
-Debug audio recorder on Benjamin's phone (API v10)


-(Josh) Change the error logging so that when you try to write to an encrypted datafile without a key (i.e., when you're in the RegisterActivity and the app hasn't yet been registered), the NPE logs a _different_ error than "tried to write to a text file before calling TextFileManager.start()"

Encryption/security
-Anonymizer function needs to be finished (Josh, see TODO in anonymizer function)
-Create shim for symmetric encryption

Write a data dump/download script

SMS log
-Log outgoing MMS messages

File upload
-Make the upload_all_files() function @synchronized because sometimes it tries to upload a file that's already been deleted (set the upload timer to something super short, like 5 seconds, to check for this).  Problem: it's also a static function.  Does this kill the effect of @synchronized, i.e., what we really want is for it to only be able to run once at a time.
-Make upload_all_files() get called by a listener that listens for new files
-Close data files/create new data files should be separate from try to upload data files (i.e., don't need to create new datafiles every time you try to upload)

-Make sure max recording time length is significantly shorter than automatic logout time

-Test and see if we're still getting the message "MediaRecorder went away with unhandled events"; if we are, try this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11984387

-Check if NULLID files are still getting created.  If they are, Figure out what to do with phones uploading NULLID files or files with a patient_id different from the patient_id in the login credentials.  Dump em?  Keep em?  Or something else?






LOW PRIORITY:

Admin authentication
-Admins should probably be able to change their passwords

Timers & data upload
-Add an alert if the phone hasn't been able to upload in a long time?
-Add a server-side alert if a patient hasn't uploaded data in a long time?

Look into optimizing battery/power consumption using timers; Eli may have already built all of this

Move Wifi timer to a repeating timer instead of having two intents (WifiLogIntent and WifiLogTimerIntent)

(Josh) Graph of survey responses
-Make it look pretty for all types of survey questions
-Make graph not crash when there are no answers
-Test display on different versions of Android (probably Android v2 and v4), and maybe different screen sizes too
-Fix crappy width scaling; don't hard-code it to 200px wide or whatever it is

Admin Panel UI
-Figure out if we're using base.html and what to do with it
-Make user unable to hit "back" button after logout, and return to the admin panel http://stackoverflow.com/a/20652896/1789466
-(Josh) Admin Panel patients list... paginate
-(Josh) Throw in an Admin Panel warning message (don't use IE < 8!)






NOT GOING TO DO THESE THINGS:

Should we try to log when the app was started?  We can't determine whether the app was started on boot or started by the user opening it.  Maybe we should just give up on this

Give researchers the ability to turn off certain listeners for a study. Clearly document how to do this, and don't forget to comment out certain permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file

Let admins see graph for any patient? (Eli says we shouldn't do this)
